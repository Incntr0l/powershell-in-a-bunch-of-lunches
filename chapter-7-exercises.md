Below is the questions to the lab exercises in Chapter 7 in the Powershell in a Month of Lunches book on Safari Books Online

Chapter 7 lab is a command line prompt to run a *PowerShell Script*, the commands I hae used are listed below.

- Get-Module *trouble* -list
- Import-Module TroubleshootingPack
- Get-TroubleshootingPack -path "C:\Windows\diagnostics\system\networking" | Invoke-TroubleshootingPack
- Press Enter
- Type 1, press Enter
- Type 2, press Enter
- Type in  "http://www.pluralsight.com/browse/it-ops" without quotations
    - If done correctly, you should see "No problems were detected" belore being allowed to enter the enxt command.

This is what I had put in and it worked, but if there are any problems I will change my answer.
